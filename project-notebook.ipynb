    "The Consumer Complaint Database is a collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that we sent to companies for response. Complaints are published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first. Complaints referred to other regulators, such as complaints about depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, are not published in the Consumer Complaint Database. The database generally updates daily. [Learn more](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/)\n",

We will not publish the narrative unless the consumer consents, and consumers can opt-out at any time. The CFPB takes reasonable steps to scrub personal information from each complaint that could be used to identify the consumer. | plain text | Consumers' descriptions of what happened are included if consumers consent to publishing the description and after we take steps to remove personal information. |\n",
