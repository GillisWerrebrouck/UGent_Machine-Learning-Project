      "Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the \" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the  PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. \n",
      "\n",

      "2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of  misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly,  unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..\n"

      "Hello. I am XXXX XXXX. Thank you for your help. I recently found out this year, in the beginning of XXXX, I had a credit issue showing up on my credit report. Back in XXXX, I opened an account with WaMu, with an additional authorized user. ( back then I was XXXX XXXX and shared this card with XXXX XXXX ). The card number was XXXX. Soon after I got the account, WaMu became Chase bank. I never used the card, but XXXX XXXX used it till XXXX of XXXX. The past statements show his last payment to the card was in XX/XX/XXXX. He made a last payment to it, for {$1500.00}. This paid the balance off, and he never used the card again. We went our separate ways. \n",
      "\n",
      "In XXXX, I bought a home and there was no issue with this card showing on my record. In XXXX, I did a refi on the same home and the issue also did not show up on my credit report. XXXX of XXXX, I did a third refi on the same home and this credit card showed up as delinquent as of XXXX of XXXX. Neither myself or XXXX XXXX have used the card since XXXX. I was told not to take care of it till after the refi, as it could hurt me during the refi. As soon as I did the refi, I contacted Chase Bank to take care of the situation. \n",
      "\n",
      "I first spoke with XXXX XXXX, and also XXXX from XXXX Missouri, both are a chase bank representative. She let me know there was an outstanding debt of {$850.00} left on the card that hadn't been paid, and that is why it went delinquent. It had gone 180 days pat due. I assumed XXXX XXXX had used the card and not paid it. When I spoke to him, he had told me he had not used it for years. Him nor I, are irresponsible with our debts. We have always paid our debts. For the record, I have never had an existing credit issue on my score, nor has he. I have never had an unpaid debt either. I agreed to pay the amount. I thought I was doing the right thing, by paying the balance, and this would fix the problem. \n",
      "\n",
      "XX/XX/XXXX, after I went through with my refi, I spoke to XXXX XXXX, to sent me an actual bill I can look at, to pay it. The bill was sent with only a balance for what I owe. No where did the bill reflect any activity of charges. I paid the bill XX/XX/XXXX, for {$850.00}. Again, I thought I was doing the right thing. {$850.00} is not a lot of money and I was happy to pay it to get this all cleared up. I had no idea this takes care of nothing or the questions I should've been asking to get it properly resolved. \n",
      "\n",
      "Time has passed and my credit score only got worse. I called Chase bank back and was pushed along to 3 people. They at this point shared the information with me on the account. Apparently, the card was charged of in XXXX and went delinquent in XXXX for going 180 days past due. The card had not been used for up to 5 years at this time. I was told after paying it, that there were 3 different consecutive charges made to my card, for {$200.00} even for each charge, at 3 different XXXX. I am assuming these were gift card purchases due to the even amounts. One at XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for {$200.00}. Another, the very next day, at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for {$200.00}, and again, on the same day at XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for {$200.00}. Myself, nor XXXX XXXX made these charges, as the activity of the card was later revealed to me. These charges are fraudulent. Even the nature of the activity of the charges seem fradulent. It is unlikely an individual would have to go to 3 different XXXX to get 3 gift cards, if they weren't trying to hide something. I never had a chance to argue these charges and the information was not disclosed with me until after I paid. I asked if they could delete the charge, as it is fraudulent and has already been paid anyway. I was told they did not have the ability to do that and it will be posted for the next 7 years. They did pass me on to their Fraudulent department. I was told I would be contacted the following week and sent an email. I haven't received a phone call, voice mail or email. I spoke with them XXXXout two weeks ago and have heard nothing from them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have always paid my bills, and have never had any credit issues. One could go back and reflect my credit history and that can be verified. I then spoke to a refi advisor, he warned me once Chase got their money it doesn't interest them to figure out my credit issue and not to expect that call. Which would seem true as they have not contacted me. That is when he gave me a link to CFPB. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would like this removed from my credit record. Any help would be greatly appreciated. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Formerly known as XXXX  )\n"

      "Hello. I am XXXX XXXX. Thank you for your help. I recently found out this year, in the beginning of XXXX, I had a credit issue showing up on my credit report. Back in XXXX, I opened an account with WaMu, with an additional authorized user. ( back then I was XXXX XXXX and shared this card with XXXX XXXX ). The card number was XXXX. Soon after I got the account, WaMu became Chase bank. I never used the card, but XXXX XXXX used it till XXXX of XXXX. The past statements show his last payment to the card was in XX/XX/XXXX. He made a last payment to it, for {$1500.00}. This paid the balance off, and he never used the card again. We went our separate ways. \n",
      "\n",
      "In XXXX, I bought a home and there was no issue with this card showing on my record. In XXXX, I did a refi on the same home and the issue also did not show up on my credit report. XXXX of XXXX, I did a third refi on the same home and this credit card showed up as delinquent as of XXXX of XXXX. Neither myself or XXXX XXXX have used the card since XXXX. I was told not to take care of it till after the refi, as it could hurt me during the refi. As soon as I did the refi, I contacted Chase Bank to take care of the situation. \n",
      "\n",
      "I first spoke with XXXX XXXX, and also XXXX from XXXX Missouri, both are a chase bank representative. She let me know there was an outstanding debt of {$850.00} left on the card that hadn't been paid, and that is why it went delinquent. It had gone 180 days pat due. I assumed XXXX XXXX had used the card and not paid it. When I spoke to him, he had told me he had not used it for years. Him nor I, are irresponsible with our debts. We have always paid our debts. For the record, I have never had an existing credit issue on my score, nor has he. I have never had an unpaid debt either. I agreed to pay the amount. I thought I was doing the right thing, by paying the balance, and this would fix the problem. \n",
      "\n",
      "XX/XX/XXXX, after I went through with my refi, I spoke to XXXX XXXX, to sent me an actual bill I can look at, to pay it. The bill was sent with only a balance for what I owe. No where did the bill reflect any activity of charges. I paid the bill XX/XX/XXXX, for {$850.00}. Again, I thought I was doing the right thing. {$850.00} is not a lot of money and I was happy to pay it to get this all cleared up. I had no idea this takes care of nothing or the questions I should've been asking to get it properly resolved. \n",
      "\n",
      "Time has passed and my credit score only got worse. I called Chase bank back and was pushed along to 3 people. They at this point shared the information with me on the account. Apparently, the card was charged of in XXXX and went delinquent in XXXX for going 180 days past due. The card had not been used for up to 5 years at this time. I was told after paying it, that there were 3 different consecutive charges made to my card, for {$200.00} even for each charge, at 3 different XXXX. I am assuming these were gift card purchases due to the even amounts. One at XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for {$200.00}. Another, the very next day, at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for {$200.00}, and again, on the same day at XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for {$200.00}. Myself, nor XXXX XXXX made these charges, as the activity of the card was later revealed to me. These charges are fraudulent. Even the nature of the activity of the charges seem fradulent. It is unlikely an individual would have to go to 3 different XXXX to get 3 gift cards, if they weren't trying to hide something. I never had a chance to argue these charges and the information was not disclosed with me until after I paid. I asked if they could delete the charge, as it is fraudulent and has already been paid anyway. I was told they did not have the ability to do that and it will be posted for the next 7 years. They did pass me on to their Fraudulent department. I was told I would be contacted the following week and sent an email. I haven't received a phone call, voice mail or email. I spoke with them XXXXout two weeks ago and have heard nothing from them.\n",

I then spoke to a refi advisor, he warned me once Chase got their money it doesn't interest them to figure out my credit issue and not to expect that call. Which would seem true as they have not contacted me. That is when he gave me a link to CFPB. \n",

      "The Facts : In XX/XX/XXXX we opened a HELOC account with XXXX XXXX. That loan was apparently sold to a securitization owned by an unknown investor on an unknown date sometime before we made the first draw on the HELOC on XX/XX/XXXX. Servicing on the HELOC was transferred to SLS sometime around XX/XX/XXXX. We sent the {$10000.00} mortgage payment by personal check ( the \" Check '' ) to SLS via USPS addressed to their designated XXXX in XXXX GA ( see attached copy of front and back of the Check ). On XX/XX/XXXX the Check was erroneously endorsed by XXXX as payable to one of their accounts and on XX/XX/XXXX the Check was cleared by XXXX and the {$10000.00} was disbursed to an unknown payee. On or before XX/XX/XXXX we discovered that the proceeds of the check had not been credited to our HELOC, and on that date we filed a claim with the Postal Inspector at the USPS and complained in writing to SLS requesting SLS to either correct the misapplication of funds or sign and send to XXXX an Affidavit of Forgery or Misapplied Funds so XXXX could pursue a claim against XXXX. We signed and delivered such an affidavit to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX we contacted the XXXX Ethics Line by email to request an investigation, since XXXX or one of its clients was the apparent recipient of the misapplied funds. On XX/XX/XXXX we received a letter from SLS ( copy attached ) disputing that they had ever received the Check and disclaiming any responsibility for the misapplication of the funds from the Check. \n",

We have paid the outstanding balance down to approximately {$10000.00} but will have difficulty paying off that remaining balance if we do not recover the {$10000.00} in misapplied funds. We have an on-going ethics investigation pending at XXXX, and have recently discovered that the loan syndication may have been purchased by XXXX, who SLS told XXXX Ethics is currently the owner of the HELOC. ( XXXX = XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. ) Since we are still investment clients of XXXX XXXX, we have requested an investigation at that entity as well. In our view, the funds are currently held by XXXX on behalf of XXXX, but the funds were erroneously deposited in the wrong XXXX account by SLS. However, XXXX has now essentially washed their hands of the situation ( see attached letter ), even though they are the key to tracing the funds at XXXX either through their auditing of the internal routing of the Check, or by providing the necessary affidavit to XXXX so it can trace the source of the erroneous endorsement at XXXX.\n",

Then today, 30+ days after my initial dispute, I get an email from XXXX saying Equifax has changed my credit score, and I got an email from Equifax saying my dispute results are ready. I went in to the report Equifax provided in the email and they put the incorrect credit balance and incorrect missed payment back on my credit report! This also dropped my credit score over 50 points! I went online to my credit card to make sure something did n't happen that I was unaware of and my statement shows it is still all paid up and XXXX owing right now and it is not late or over the credit limit like Equifax changed it back to!

      "\t In earlyXX/XX/XXXX, my bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( the \" Bank ' ) began working on a home refinance application that my husband and I had submitted. The bank works with secondary lenders that have a policy not to lend money if an applicant 's credit history shows that any account listed with the 3 credit  bureaus is in dispute. On or about XX/XX/XXXX, the Bank contacted me to advise that secondary lenders had submitted credit inquiries on us, but would not lend money for the refinance because my husband & I had disputes pending on several listed long-closed accounts. My husband & I immediately called the 3 credit bureaus to ask that the disputes & related comments be removed from our credit histories. ( We filed these disputes for two reasons : errors concerning a mix-up with our son 's address and our address ; and disputes concerning several 30 day late payments when the U.S. postal service delivered our mail to our son 's address. The disputes ' comments were several years old. We had forgotten about them, altogether. ) The credit bureaus removed the disputes from my husband 's credit history after a few repeated phone calls by him. The 3 bureaus told me that all disputes on my credit history were removed, too. TransUnion sent me a statement, datedXX/XX/XXXX, about action taken on the accounts, stating, as to each the account, \" Disputed Information Updated. '' On XX/XX/XXXX, we contacted the Bank and advised that the bureaus said that the disputes were removed because that 's what the credit bureaus ' representatives assured us over the phone OnXX/XX/XXXX, the Bank emailed me and advised that the secondary lenders had submitted credit inquiries again, but two-three accounts on my history, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, were still showing disputes ' commentary, and the secondary lenders would not lend. So, I called the 3 credit bureaus again and asked that they remove the disputes ' commentary from those accounts. They said that they would. On XX/XX/XXXX, I  spoke with the Bank and advised that the 3 credit bureaus had cleared the disputes. XXXX sent me a statement, datedXX/XX/XXXX, stating with respect to the 3 accounts, \" [ w ] e have completed the processing of your dispute ( s ) '' with the results stated as \" Outcome : Updated - Information on this item has been updated. Please review your report for the details. '' The comments in my attached report stated \" [ t ] his item was updated from our processing of your dispute in XX/XX/XXXX. '' I did not receive any documentation/or report from XXXX or TransUnion. So, the Bank proceeded with our refinance application and more credit inquiries on our credit history were made by the secondary lenders. On XX/XX/XXXX, the Bank 's representative e-mailed me to advise me that the 3 accounts were still showing disputes comments, and that our credit scores were lowering each time credit inquiries were made by the secondary lenders. My husband and I are extremely frustrated and angry with the 3 credit bureaus. The commentary about disputes on my credit history should have been removed, immediately. Creditors did not place these comments on these old closed accounts - I did. I should be able to easily have them removed and all references thereof, as well. And secondly, our credit history has been negatively impacted ( lowered scores!! ) by all of these repeated inquiries during XXXX & XXXX just when we are about to refinance. We want ALL MENTION of DISPUTES removed from our credit histories, and we want all negative impacts to our credit history from repeated inquiries reversed and rectified, as well.\n",

I called the company at the number above included in their letter inquiring why I was receiving this letter if I did not have a payroll card and do not get paid via payroll card.

I again asked why I received this letter at which time they started asking me for additional personal information such as my employer, which I did not provide. I continued to inquire, and they refused to explain the situation and only repeated many times that my employer provided my name and address and I would be receiving a payroll card - which I repeatedly told them my employer said is not true. Comdata was completely unhelpful at best and directly ducking questions at worst. They ultimately hung up on me rather than trying to get the the bottom of things.

As a XXXX XXXX ive been exposed to the beauty that is American law, mainly the constutution. In my opinion the second greatest document written behind the XXXX. I see a tragedy. The federal reserve system ( fractional illegal banking ) most Americans have no idea how our banking system works let alone the federal Reserve. It literally is the greatest ponzi scheme in history. Its completely unconstitutional and has created a disportion of wealth where the majority are slaves to banks. No where in our constitution does it state an independent banking system issuing these federal reserve notes that are now practical worthless has any authority, nor use our federal taxes as collateral against these loans. Then the big banks have devised perfect system that manipulate money and creates it out of thin air through credit. Its pathetic. Its made the rich richer and the poor poorer. Im going to stop my save the world speech and say this. XXXX  followed tax law and im asking XXXX and Transunion to follow suit and do what united state federal tax law tells one to do in the following situation. Im asking every single one of my creditors to follow the United States tax law with regards to debt. I want every single one of my creditors who wrote off my debt as a loss on their tax returns and recouped their money to remove that debt from XXXX and Transunion. The Federal tax law states \" Attempting to collect such monies, fees, etc. for an unsecured debt that has been claimed on federal taxes as a loss, and sold to another company for compensation constitutes fraud in any of the 50 states. '' It makes sense and all my creditors didnt hide they wrote it off. I want these collection companies who have no legal claim to this debt that again has been written off removed from my credit report and in reality they themselves are commiting tax fraud by trying to collect on these debts that no longer belong to me off my credit report. This is the law. Its not enforced but it should be. Big banks have lawyers who know tax law and get their clients to pay little to no taxes. XXXX followed the law and removed these items from my ctedit report. Since its the law I expect transunion and XXXX  to do the same or they to are commiting fraud.\n",

I called Santander and they stated that the paperwork was not finished processing until XX/XX/XXXXso that 's why its a late on my credit. Santander waited until my account was 30 days late then they processed the paperwork. That is fraud because they purposely waited until my account was past due then processed the paperwork.

My insurance company quickly came provided me an estimate of damage along with a check for XXXX in turn I needed to have submitted to my mortgage company to have them endorse and return the funds. Midland Mortgage asked for the following information : Endorsed check, insurance estimate ( all pages ) and receipts of items purchased. I sent all items requested and they confirmed receipt of all documents on XXXX which was a long time since I mailed them over night on XXXX. I felt it was unsafe for me and my family to wait for the money to be dispersed by the mortgage company so I went ahead and purchased all the materials and paid to have the work done with my savings. It has been approximately 15 business days since they claim they received the documents according the to post office they received them on XXXX ( which that would be 21 business days ). I have contacted Midland Mortgage repeatedly to ensure I sent them all the correct documentation and that my claim was being processed I was advised all documents needed were received and they would begin processing it. I was first told they were working on it, I paid my mortgage payment on the XXXX of XXXX and called on the XXXX to follow up in a weeks time and they than told me that they just started working on it and it could take up to 20 business days to process. I called today 14 business days after they claim they received the paperwork and was told I would have to wait at least another 7-10 business days for processing than at that time a decision would be made. I do n't understand what decision has to be made? My mortgage payments are up to date, the damage has been fixed all of it, my insurance company worked quickly and provided me the monies to avoid a mold issue, luckily I had the savings to cover the cost if not my family and I would be living in a house that would be prone to mold. Midland mortgage should not have the right to hold the money that is rightfully mine as I pay for my insurance as I am not behind in any of my payments, especially if the work is already completed.\n",

I asked My account manager for options And she was able to work up a modification plan but the problem with the modification plan is it requires over {$4000.00} as a good faith payment upfront. In the past they have waived the good faith payment and are refusing to waive it now. I then asked for a deed in Leiu Of foreclosure, basically a cash for keys which in my first conversation with my account manager she stated I would be eligible for at least {$3000.00} but will try to get me more. She then moved forward getting the modification but never worked on the cash for keys, asked her to check on it she put me on hold and five minutes later came back and said her VP said no cash for keys but they would take the keys and the deed. I said I cant come up with the {$4000.00} I once again asked for something for the deed, she began to argue with me. I can not tell you how many times Ive had to deal with Fay Servicing, they have put me in to other modifications which I told them were too expensive for me to handle I just want to be done with the house but I would need some sort of cash amount in an effort to be able to get a security deposit and first months rent with an apartment. I think it has been their goal all along to try to push me out of the house. The investors that own The mortgage have modified several times before without a good-faith payment, they have also offered me cash for keys in the past which I did not take because at the time I wanted to keep the house. Fay Servicing is  extremely dishonest and they treat people that are having financial struggles horribly. I have read other situations which they push forward with foreclosure which is what they did when they first got my loan a few years ago. I was under a forbearance agreement with my former mortgage servicer, and once they purchased it they immediately put my house back into foreclosure. This is a tactic they use, the only reason I still have the house is because I fought it.\n",

      "\t Hi there, so on XXXX XXXX - I mobile deposited a check I got for {$1100.00} into my Chase account, from the rental company of my apartment for the past 2 years. It was my security deposit I was getting back from having moved out. The rental company is called XXXX XXXX XXXX. The following Monday, the XXXX, I discovered only XXXX $ of the check had deposited - so I called Chase to find out what happened, and they informed me that my account was being restricted. And in order to lift the restriction they had to speak to the maker of the check, XXXX XXXX XXXX. And if they did not speak to the maker, the account would close in 10 days and the money would be held in suspension indefinitely. Unfortunately, XXXX XXXX XXXX does not have an office phone number, as it is independently owned, so I was unable to put Chase in contact with them. Chase told me they must speak with the maker, or I could have them put a stop on the check. But when I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX ( the bank the check came from ), they told me they could not stop the check because the funds were cleared from their account and were placed into my Chase account. I attempted numerous times to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX, but they refused to provide a direct # for Chase to call, and Chase refused to provide a direct # for XXXX to call. And XXXX XXXX kept telling me there was nothing they could do, as it was out of their hands. I 've tried to find every possible loophole, but now Chase has closed my account completely, still holding the funds in suspension. They refuse to both return the funds back to XXXX XXXX, or lift the restriction off my account for me to access the funds, unless they speak directly to XXXX XXXX XXXX. Which, as I said, I am unable to put them in contact with. I 've spoken to several banks and they all say there is no reason Chase should want or need to speak with the maker of the check, they should only need to talk to XXXX XXXX to establish that the check is legitimate and the funds were cleared. Also, a few days before my account closed, I saw that the complete funds, {$1100.00} were in my account! Which means the check did clear and they were legitimate, however Chase still kept a restriction on my account and insisted on speaking with the maker. I am at a loss of what else to do, I feel like I 've had this money stolen from me, for no reason, and I hope there is a way to fix this situation and get me the security deposit I rightfully earned. Thankyou.\n",

So a value of $ XXXX with addition is just plain wrong. email sent to Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX I have at least three properties that show per-renovation value at between {$84.00} to {$130.00} per sq ft for similar properties. I think I found the problem. The basement is 100 % finished and is XXXX for one and his comps are not good at all. Below are three good comps. The total square foot for my house without addition is XXXX minus XXXX sqft for utility room in basement, XXXX upper and XXXX lower plus XXXX additional for new addition.

      "\t I was making regular monthly payments on my schools loans until XXXX when my husband lost his job of 32 years and we were forced into a XXXX XXXX bankruptcy to save our home. I was in a forbearance on my school loans for the 5 years I was in the bankruptcy. I was unable to access my account online and CS would not speak to me about my account during this time. The bankruptcy was dissolved in XXXX XXXX. I never received any statements from Navient. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX I receive an email stating that I was severely delinquent on my account. They were demanding over {$600.00} from me to be current. I called right away ... XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to discuss that this was the first notification I ever received from their company. The customer service rep insisted that they have been sending me numerous emails and they must have gone to my spam mail. However, I seem to be getting their numerous emails now. She also insisted that I demanded my statements through email, which I have never requested with this company. Most of my dealings were with XXXX XXXX. I never set up an account with Navient until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when I received their email. Before the bankruptcy I received a paper statement in the mail every month. I explained to the CS rep that I lost my husband unexpectedly on XXXX XXXX, XXXX of this year and was left with no life insurance policy and my home is in the middle of foreclosure. I have been forced to find a place to rent and there was no way I can pay what they claim is my late charges and I can not afford the {$220.00} a month they expect as my monthly payments. Before the bankruptcy I was paying {$55.00} a month and I am not sure why it is so much now. She did explain that I could complete an application for an Income Driven Repayment plan and is sending me that in the mail. In the mean time she told me that she would put my loan in forbearance eliminating the past due amounts and my payments would be {$110.00} month starting in XXXX XXXX. However, my account on their site says something totally different and I have numerous emails now coming to me with different payment amounts. The latest one this morning stated that my monthly payment was {$190.00} due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. No one at this company seems to know what they are doing. You get a different answer every time you speak to someone and the amount you owe and the payments required changes constantly. They are unorganized and not very helpful. I just think this company should have better control over the services for their customers and be more accommodating to their individual needs and life circumstances and this would help them get the money that is owed. I am not looking to ignore my obligation. I am looking for someone to work with me to find a monthly amount I can afford and update my account on their website correctly so I can manage this and send me the emails that I need confirming the amount that I am obligated to pay each month and follow this up in writing and mailed to my home address. Although the representative I spoke with yesterday did soften once I told her my life situation, she was not very knowledgeable and did not update anything on my account. I also do not feel this company is very truthful. They never sent me any emails, nor did they ever notify me that my forbearance was now over and I needed to start paying on my loan. I got nothing except for the horrible email yesterday stating that I was delinquent. My husband and I had wonderful credit until 5 years ago when we fell on hard times. Instead of doing what the rest of America did and walk away from our mortgage, we stayed, filed the chapter XXXX and paid our mortgage every month ... only for me to lose my husband and now I will lose my house anyway. I am willing to pay my obligation to this company and believe in paying my debts ... I just need them to be truthful, upfront and helpful in getting a payment I can afford and updating their information correctly for people to manage their accounts effectively. I also feel that a follow up letter should always come through the mail if they feel someone is delinquent in their payments. They should not be relying on email. Thank you XXXX XXXX XXXX\n",

I told him I had no unpaid bill from XXXX but he persisted by raising his voice, insisting that this debt would go to collection to the credit reporting agencies and negatively effect my credit. He refused to acknowledge the fact that his information was wrong and that it was most likely a mistake and even said I would not accomplish anything by calling XXXX because they had already transferred the debt to AFNI. I asked him to repeat the information he had. He again recited an account number and service address that was not associated with me so I asked how he could report anything to credit agencies if the debt wasn't mine. In response he actually said that the effect of the negative report would be more costly on me than the actual debt which he said was only {$120.00}, however, he would discount it to {$90.00} if I paid it now. I then started recording and asked him to identify himself which he at first refused saying he would never give me his last name. He then argued that I had been dodging him by not answering previous calls. I stated typically don't answer unknown numbers especially if they don't leave a message. He said they never leave messages. His overall language was threatening and harassing in nature. At this point I fully believe based on this conversation that AFNI will take action even though the debt isn't valid and they only made contact by phone. I have not received any official notice by mail, from XXXX or from AFNI establishing that I had any unpaid bill.\n",

I made contact with Equifax on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. I have spoken to several representatives. Back on XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with a rep by the name of XXXX and he removed XXXX inquiries for me with a confirmation number of XXXX. I received the dispute results via email and was ecstatic and then I became upset when I noticed that some of the same inquiries were still listed. I was livid. So I called, disputed, called and disputed again. On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with 2 reps and then finally a supervisor-named XXXX-rep ID XXXX who was very rude and did not try to assist me. I spent an hour and 37 minutes on the phone with her trying to plead my case and also make her aware that these inquiries that are on my report were made while in fact there was a fraud alert and security freeze on my file. She said I needed to file a police report, to me that makes absolutely y no sense at all. I have already reached out to the companies and b/c there arent any open accounts attached to my social security number they are unable to provide me with any type of letter to assist me with the removal of the inquiries. The only thing Id like is for the issue at hand to be resolved and the inquiries DELETED. Hopefully, this time around I will get some type of satisfaction. At this point I dont know what else to do, but Id like for this to go away. Thank you for your time and please see the attachments.

      "\t I have a balance of XXXX plus dollars on my account and there should be a XXXX dollar balance currently as all transactions were fraud on the account since XXXX. I filed multiple claims multiple times but they never got back to me or re-credited my account. I do n't even see credits from large fraud charges to merchant. PNC has not even proved to me that I made the charges. IF I know I did not make the charges, then how does them simply doing an investigation that does n't even entail any real proof make them correct and me wrong? There are many more charges of all kinds that I have not received credit for even though I claimed them as fraud and the investigations are now all complete. I should get all my credits valuing to the amount of my current total balance. I can not even see the statements at this point thus I do n't even know what charges PNC is holding my liable for as of now that equals my total current balance. This has already disrupted my credit report, so I also seek additional compensation for damages caused by them not changing my revolving my balance on time and having this account in bad standing for 6 months or more, for no reason, and I should not have to be responsible for such damage. If I knew PNC would have such poor response rate and fix to fraud charges, I would not have signed up for this credit card. I am even a preferred card member where I pay an extra XXXX dollars a year. They should treat me better than this. This is my third complaint against PNC now using this CFPB service. They still have not done anything. I have not seen any proof that any of those charges were mine ever since they occurred back in 2015. All the charges on the account, I have not even seen statements, hence I do not recognize any of the charges on this account at all. It has been a year and a half almost two years, and I have not seen credits. The policy of the card is such that if the customer does not recognize charges, PNC provides credits, and PNC still has not done so ...\n",

The original purchase price of the car was XXXX and paid a monthly note of XXXX. My car note was paid every month on time and was never ever late. After XXXX  months of on time payments, I was involved in a XXXX XXXX XXXX ( no fault of my own ) which totaled the vehicle and sent me to the hospital with all types of XXXX and XXXX bills to pay in the future. The accident was considered a non-contest and the drive of the other vehicle was cited and his insurance company was required to pay all my medical bills and time off work. My insurance company totaled the vehicle and paid XXXX XXXX XXXX arpx XXXX due to the blue book value of the car. I did not have XXXX XXXX therefore I was left with a difference/balance on the vehicle. Within a matter of days, XXXX XXXX XXXX reported my account to the credit bureau and a repossession. Since the vehicle was reported as a repossession, I was not allowed to make payments toward the account. What I did not understand is how can my vehicle be repoed and Ive never ever been late on a payment. I tried to resolve this situation several times with XXXX XXXX XXXX. I even agreed to a payment plan with XXXX XXXX XXXX. The company accepted my XXXX payment however, to date the account balance still remains the same. I grew tired to trying to deal with the finance company and decided to resolve this situation through the credit bureau. I decided to dispute the account with XXXX XXXX and Experian. Once I disputed the account, XXXX XXXX XXXX was forced to change the status of my account from repossession to Late/Charge-off/Seriously past due. This status is still incorrect. This account would have been paid off if I were allowed to continue to make on time payments. My frustration currently is the account is still being reported incorrectly. I was never late on this account and my status should reflect accurate data. At this point, all I want to do is clear my good name and regain my credit worthiness the honest way. This is an injustice and just another example of how these big finance companies prey on the day to day hard working citizen. \n",

Today I received a paper statement and this time I opened it, ( I usually do n't because I make my payment online. ) The statement said I owed a {$37.00} late fee.

XXXX applied for permission to issue diplomas from the XXXX State Department of Education and was denied permission on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The Department, in its rejection letter to XXXX, stated that it had determined XXXX was primarily a behavior-modification facility and not a boarding school. A lawsuit against XXXX for issuing fake diplomas was also filed and a judge upheld its validity in XXXX XXXX.

A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft.

      "\t In 2012 I filed paperwork with Nelnet to have my student loans consolidated so that I may qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness. While all of my loans were transferred to Nelnet at that time, it recently came to my attention that Nelnet did not consolidate the FFEL Stafford Loans and Grad PLUS Loans that they held, leaving half of my loans ineligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. I trusted them to act in my best interests and consolidate the loans for the purpose I stated. They clearly did not do this. I am submitting a copy of the Federal Direct Loan Consolidation paperwork, where it shows that the loans they held were listed both on the Loans You Want to Consolidate page, then listed again on the Loans You Dont Want To Consolidate page, only on that page the loan number and balances are missing. This is very deceiving. Furthermore, they never sent me a letter finalizing the consolidation, but put me into an Income Based Repayment Plan with assurances that all was well.\n",
      "When I spoke to Nelnet recently and inquired about the consolidation and requested a copy of their paperwork ( so I could match it with the copy I possess from 2012 ), they stated they had no such record on file. This seems suspect as there currently are XXXX consolidated loans on my Nelnet account. They most definitely consolidated the loans from XXXX/XXXX XXXX and that is all they consolidated. This move has potentially cost me 5 years of payments counting towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness.\n",

I was told the only way I can pay off the {$20.00} was if I paid off my full balance first of almost {$1900.00} and until then I'll be forever paying for the {$20.00}, which for me would take a long time as I don't have that sort of money as a XXXX parent of XXXX kids to just send over {$1900.00}. \n",
