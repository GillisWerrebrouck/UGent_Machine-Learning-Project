      "Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the \" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the  PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. \n",
      "\n",

      "2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of  misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly,  unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..\n"

      "Hello. I am XXXX XXXX. Thank you for your help. I recently found out this year, in the beginning of XXXX, I had a credit issue showing up on my credit report. Back in XXXX, I opened an account with WaMu, with an additional authorized user. ( back then I was XXXX XXXX and shared this card with XXXX XXXX ). The card number was XXXX. Soon after I got the account, WaMu became Chase bank. I never used the card, but XXXX XXXX used it till XXXX of XXXX. The past statements show his last payment to the card was in XX/XX/XXXX. He made a last payment to it, for {$1500.00}. This paid the balance off, and he never used the card again. We went our separate ways. \n",
      "\n",
      "In XXXX, I bought a home and there was no issue with this card showing on my record. In XXXX, I did a refi on the same home and the issue also did not show up on my credit report. XXXX of XXXX, I did a third refi on the same home and this credit card showed up as delinquent as of XXXX of XXXX. Neither myself or XXXX XXXX have used the card since XXXX. I was told not to take care of it till after the refi, as it could hurt me during the refi. As soon as I did the refi, I contacted Chase Bank to take care of the situation. \n",
      "\n",
      "I first spoke with XXXX XXXX, and also XXXX from XXXX Missouri, both are a chase bank representative. She let me know there was an outstanding debt of {$850.00} left on the card that hadn't been paid, and that is why it went delinquent. It had gone 180 days pat due. I assumed XXXX XXXX had used the card and not paid it. When I spoke to him, he had told me he had not used it for years. Him nor I, are irresponsible with our debts. We have always paid our debts. For the record, I have never had an existing credit issue on my score, nor has he. I have never had an unpaid debt either. I agreed to pay the amount. I thought I was doing the right thing, by paying the balance, and this would fix the problem. \n",
      "\n",
      "XX/XX/XXXX, after I went through with my refi, I spoke to XXXX XXXX, to sent me an actual bill I can look at, to pay it. The bill was sent with only a balance for what I owe. No where did the bill reflect any activity of charges. I paid the bill XX/XX/XXXX, for {$850.00}. Again, I thought I was doing the right thing. {$850.00} is not a lot of money and I was happy to pay it to get this all cleared up. I had no idea this takes care of nothing or the questions I should've been asking to get it properly resolved. \n",
      "\n",
      "Time has passed and my credit score only got worse. I called Chase bank back and was pushed along to 3 people. They at this point shared the information with me on the account. Apparently, the card was charged of in XXXX and went delinquent in XXXX for going 180 days past due. The card had not been used for up to 5 years at this time. I was told after paying it, that there were 3 different consecutive charges made to my card, for {$200.00} even for each charge, at 3 different XXXX. I am assuming these were gift card purchases due to the even amounts. One at XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for {$200.00}. Another, the very next day, at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for {$200.00}, and again, on the same day at XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for {$200.00}. Myself, nor XXXX XXXX made these charges, as the activity of the card was later revealed to me. These charges are fraudulent. Even the nature of the activity of the charges seem fradulent. It is unlikely an individual would have to go to 3 different XXXX to get 3 gift cards, if they weren't trying to hide something. I never had a chance to argue these charges and the information was not disclosed with me until after I paid. I asked if they could delete the charge, as it is fraudulent and has already been paid anyway. I was told they did not have the ability to do that and it will be posted for the next 7 years. They did pass me on to their Fraudulent department. I was told I would be contacted the following week and sent an email. I haven't received a phone call, voice mail or email. I spoke with them XXXXout two weeks ago and have heard nothing from them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have always paid my bills, and have never had any credit issues. One could go back and reflect my credit history and that can be verified. I then spoke to a refi advisor, he warned me once Chase got their money it doesn't interest them to figure out my credit issue and not to expect that call. Which would seem true as they have not contacted me. That is when he gave me a link to CFPB. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would like this removed from my credit record. Any help would be greatly appreciated. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Formerly known as XXXX  )\n"

      "Hello. I am XXXX XXXX. Thank you for your help. I recently found out this year, in the beginning of XXXX, I had a credit issue showing up on my credit report. Back in XXXX, I opened an account with WaMu, with an additional authorized user. ( back then I was XXXX XXXX and shared this card with XXXX XXXX ). The card number was XXXX. Soon after I got the account, WaMu became Chase bank. I never used the card, but XXXX XXXX used it till XXXX of XXXX. The past statements show his last payment to the card was in XX/XX/XXXX. He made a last payment to it, for {$1500.00}. This paid the balance off, and he never used the card again. We went our separate ways. \n",
      "\n",
      "In XXXX, I bought a home and there was no issue with this card showing on my record. In XXXX, I did a refi on the same home and the issue also did not show up on my credit report. XXXX of XXXX, I did a third refi on the same home and this credit card showed up as delinquent as of XXXX of XXXX. Neither myself or XXXX XXXX have used the card since XXXX. I was told not to take care of it till after the refi, as it could hurt me during the refi. As soon as I did the refi, I contacted Chase Bank to take care of the situation. \n",
      "\n",
      "I first spoke with XXXX XXXX, and also XXXX from XXXX Missouri, both are a chase bank representative. She let me know there was an outstanding debt of {$850.00} left on the card that hadn't been paid, and that is why it went delinquent. It had gone 180 days pat due. I assumed XXXX XXXX had used the card and not paid it. When I spoke to him, he had told me he had not used it for years. Him nor I, are irresponsible with our debts. We have always paid our debts. For the record, I have never had an existing credit issue on my score, nor has he. I have never had an unpaid debt either. I agreed to pay the amount. I thought I was doing the right thing, by paying the balance, and this would fix the problem. \n",
      "\n",
      "XX/XX/XXXX, after I went through with my refi, I spoke to XXXX XXXX, to sent me an actual bill I can look at, to pay it. The bill was sent with only a balance for what I owe. No where did the bill reflect any activity of charges. I paid the bill XX/XX/XXXX, for {$850.00}. Again, I thought I was doing the right thing. {$850.00} is not a lot of money and I was happy to pay it to get this all cleared up. I had no idea this takes care of nothing or the questions I should've been asking to get it properly resolved. \n",
      "\n",
      "Time has passed and my credit score only got worse. I called Chase bank back and was pushed along to 3 people. They at this point shared the information with me on the account. Apparently, the card was charged of in XXXX and went delinquent in XXXX for going 180 days past due. The card had not been used for up to 5 years at this time. I was told after paying it, that there were 3 different consecutive charges made to my card, for {$200.00} even for each charge, at 3 different XXXX. I am assuming these were gift card purchases due to the even amounts. One at XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for {$200.00}. Another, the very next day, at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for {$200.00}, and again, on the same day at XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for {$200.00}. Myself, nor XXXX XXXX made these charges, as the activity of the card was later revealed to me. These charges are fraudulent. Even the nature of the activity of the charges seem fradulent. It is unlikely an individual would have to go to 3 different XXXX to get 3 gift cards, if they weren't trying to hide something. I never had a chance to argue these charges and the information was not disclosed with me until after I paid. I asked if they could delete the charge, as it is fraudulent and has already been paid anyway. I was told they did not have the ability to do that and it will be posted for the next 7 years. They did pass me on to their Fraudulent department. I was told I would be contacted the following week and sent an email. I haven't received a phone call, voice mail or email. I spoke with them XXXXout two weeks ago and have heard nothing from them.\n",

I then spoke to a refi advisor, he warned me once Chase got their money it doesn't interest them to figure out my credit issue and not to expect that call. Which would seem true as they have not contacted me. That is when he gave me a link to CFPB. \n",

      "\t I wish to file a complaint against XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and Transunion, disputing a {$3.00} interest charge on a XXXX XXXX credit card account I had paid in full on XXXX XXXX, 2016. This $ XXXX interest charge was added to my account AFTER my payment in full was made, was done without my knowledge and for which I never received a bill. Obviously, I did not make a payment on a bill I did not receive! Because I subscribe to XXXX Credit Tracker, an alert made me aware on XXXX XXXX, 2016 that this account had been tagged as \" more than 30 days '' overdue. I investigated on XXXX XXXX 's website and made payment immediately to not let the credit damage worsen. I then immediately disputed the negative notation on my account - not the that the payment was late by 2 days according to XXXX XXXX 's records, but that it was \" late '' because XXXX XXXX had FAILED to make me aware of the charge. \n",

Inaccurate, incomplete or unverifiable information must be removed or corrected, usually within 30 days. '' Credit reporting agencies MUST correct UNVERIFIABLE information on my credit history. Yet all three agencies have refused to do so even though XXXX XXXX CAN NOT VERIFY that I had knowledge of this {$3.00} interest charge, other than to say they mailed me a bill. But I dispute that I ever received such a bill! No credit agency has attempted an independent investigation. They simply accept XXXX XXXX 's UNVERIFIABLE claim when the VERIFIABLE evidence of my diligence in paying bills is reflected in the fact that I paid this charge IMMEDIATELY when I became aware of it! \n",
      "\n",
      "XXXX XXXX 's UNVERIFIABLE information should ALONE be reason enough for the reporting agencies to delete this negative notation from my credit history under the FCRA. But none of these parties will act on my disputes because they rely solely on XXXX XXXX for information, even though consumer reporting agencies \" must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or UNVERIFIABLE information. '' This inflexibility over {$3.00} is all the more galling given XXXX XXXX 's recent {$180.00} XXXX fine by the Consumer Protection Bureau -- for FRAUD. Why is the fraudulent XXXX XXXX organization more trusted by the credit reporting agencies than me?! \n",

A 7-year sentence on my credit history for a disputed {$3.00} payment it not merely unfair, it qualifies as cruel and unusual punishment! \n",
      "\n",
      "What is a lone consumer like me to do when up against the impersonal, bureaucratized inflexibility of a too-big-to-fail bank and automated credit reporting systems with default algorithms, enforced by \" customer service '' automatons, that can not and will not take into account the simple human error of an undelivered piece of mail? My credit report NOW indicates I am \" fair '' credit risk because XXXX XXXX did not send and I did not pay a XXXX payment. My behavior demonstrates that I am an excellent credit risk - and is that not what my FICO score should reflect? This disparity would be the very definition of an Unfair Credit Reporting Act. \n",

      "\t For over 30 years I have had a credit card account with Chase. A few months ago I decided to add an authorized user on my account because I had n't used the account in quite a while. Well from the moment my authorized user began using the account it was one headache after another! Now I appreciate and understand Cjase wanting to make sure that no funny business is going on with the account but what they did and are doing should be illegal. I informed Chase in writing that the account would be used by my authorized user and at which stores, dates and approximate amounts spent. Well they kept freezing the card and I would have to call them or wait for them to call me to verify activity on the account. This happened at least 5 times in 3 weeks. In XX/XX/XXXX I put in for a balance transfer offer that Chase was doing at the time for a couple of credit cards that I had some small balances on. Bear in mind these were my own accounts in my name only. Well Chase decided to shut down my account, remove my authorized user and not communicate with me as to why it was being done. My credit limit was {$26000.00} and there were approximately {$14000.00} worth of charges to the account including the balance transfers. For 2 weeks every time I tried to call to get information about what was going on I kept being told that I would have to wait for someone in another department to call me. The call never came. Then I find out through my authorized user that Chase closed the original account and set up a new account with a XXXX balance. I never received a new card, a letter or anything explaining what was going on. So when I call then XX/XX/XXXX they tell me that I need to go into a branch with a valid photo ID before any information can be shared with me. Despite the fact that I have a credit alert on my credit report which gives my number to call to verify Chase never did that. If I had been asked to go into a branch back in XX/XX/XXXX when this all began I absolutely would not have had a problem doing so. However, it was a month or so later after they had taken all of these actions without so much as a phone call or letter of explanation. And if I had not been made aware of the new account and called myself I never would have been notified that they wanted me to come into a branch. And to top it off last week after showing that the balance is XXXX and refusing to give me access to my account online, they withdrew a payment from my authorized user bank account for payment! My authorized user bank account info was on the account because they had agreed to have payments come directly out of their account since they were using the account. It was really all about rebuilding their credit. So I want Chase to either give me access to my account and send me new cards or to stop reporting this to the credit bureaus. They took over my accounts as completely as any identity thief ever could!\n",

So unfortunately, we decided to pay XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$3000.00} because they guaranteed that they could help us negotiate with OCWEN. Another swindler.

Is this legal? Certainly it is n't ethical! \n",

We have had to incur legal fees in order to get them to even return a phone call, which actually added to our financial hardship that we were trying to resolve with our mortgage in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most recently, pursuant to the request of the attorney for SLS in XX/XX/XXXX, we filed a request for loan modification on our mortgage loan. We had previously filed a request for mortgage assistance in XX/XX/XXXX, which was never acknowledged, responded to or addressed by SLS. Rather, they filed a Notice of Foreclosure and we had to hire an attorney to help us navigate through that. We ended up having to file a Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy to protect our home. During the time the banrkuptcy was being finalized, we continued making our payments in the amount of {$2600.00}, and SLS never filed an proof of claim as required by law. At the very end of the bankruptcy, they filed a Notice of Default and we had to negotiate with them for another several weeks before our bankruptcy could be approved by the courts. They insisted on a monthly payment of {$4100.00} because they would not add the arrearages to the balance of our mortgage, despite the fact there is plenty of equity to do so. We have never been able to make that payment and after discussing this with the attorney for SLS and our attorney, we were told to file a new Request for Mortgage Assistance which would be to lower our monthly payment so we could get our mortgage back in a current status. We did this in XX/XX/XXXX. SLS acknowledged receipt of the modification in three separate letters datedXX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXXand again on XX/XX/XXXX. Each letter stated they were waiting for information which was out of our control and they would respond as soon as that information was received. We heard absolutely nothing from SLS until we received a letter last Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  out of XXXX, Texas, advising us of a Notice of Default on the mortgage. There has still been no reference to our Request for Mortgage Assistance filed last XX/XX/XXXX to SLS. We responded to the letter yesterday via fax, express mail and regular mail advising of this situation and requesting our Loan Assistance application be approved so we can get back on track with our mortgage. We desperately need help getting this situation resolved as they are threatening foreclosure.\n",

      "\t The loan with American First Finance was started XX/XX/XXXX. I had a late payment on XXXX occasions in XXXX and XXXX and had arrangements to pay. They still called my place of employment for payment before the agreement date came. I called the main office and asked them to not call my job and reminded them they have my cell and home number and should use those. I was told they use an automated dialer and they would take measures to see that this shouldn't happen again. The same thing happened with the XXXX payment agreement. I again called and asked them to remove my work number because when they call they just ask for \"XXXX\" as though they are a friend or family member. I was told they would note not to call my employer. There came a time when I missed another payment and they started calling my job again several times a day. I explained I only work XXXX day a week at most and if I am not home to take the call they call my employer. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a text message saying my account was eligible for loan rehab. I spoke with representatives every day for the next few weeks who told me they would send me an email with the details of the rehab program, I explained that each person before them promised to send the email but I have never received it. I spoke with someone named XXXX later in XXXX who stated she would personally be handling my case from now on and she also never sent the email. Now I am getting calls many times a day and usually speak with XXXX people a day who say they will send the email. There was one occasion when they called my job in XXXX and I explained I was at work, a XXXX used her \"XXXX\" so i had to answer it. I asked the rep if I could call them back when I went on break. She continued to talk to me about my late payment. My superior was sitting near me and told me I can't have calls that disrupt my job like that and someone calls me daily at work and this had to stop. On XXXX I was at work and they called again. I asked the rep if my work number has a note or something showing they should not be calling and she stated \"no\" but she would be removing it from the system. I got calls XXXX @ XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. On XXXX @ XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, On XXXX @XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. These are just the times from the most recent calls. There have been days when I speak with at least XXXX people in one day. XXXX I spoke with  XXXX who informed me they don't have the loan rehab program and now they have a \"fresh start\" program which just starts the loan all over again. They have the loan rehab details in writing but she won't send me that because it won't help me (and they don't offer that anymore) I have to use the the fresh start and for that program they have nothing in writing. She also stated that my work number shows up in red but it is still on my account. There seems to be a lot of misinformation coming from this company I've offered to make arrangements that I know I can keep but that is not acceptable to them. My working depends on the amount of XXXX and recently it has been sparse. I ask for things in writing now since I see it is a practice of them to just say anything to get you to make a payment with no thought as to how they are treating their customers. I have written them via email to make them aware I am seeking advice and help and also to report their actions. I have also been told to speak with the store to see if they would take the merchandise back and they would remove the loan.  this was also untrue as the store doesn't do refunds. Do they not know the policy of the merchants they deal with or was this just another lie i was being told?\n",

I contacted Loancare via phone on XX/XX/XXXX informing them that I had changed my insurance carrier to XXXX who had notified me that they have forwarded the coverage documents to them ( Loancare ) already and that the insurance with XXXX is approximately {$150.00} less annually and my County taxes had an increase for XXXX ( yes XXXX ) for the entire year of XX/XX/XXXX, which meant that I could n't possibly have a shortage in escrow after reviewing it and doing the math on a few occasions. In fact, I have an overage. I was told that the escrow account would be analyzed and they would follow up with me. After 2 weeks I did n't hear from them and phoned and I was informed by the customer service representative to call back in another week. I did and was informed that the account was correct after their analysis. I asked to speak to someone in the department that did the review and was informed per the customer service representative that the department that did escrow analysis did not speak with customers and that I could only speak to a customer representative.

I restated my concern about the escrow account being incorrect and that there is not a shortage in escrow and to send me a line item review of how they arrived to the decision that there is a shortage. I phoned again today, XX/XX/XXXX and was informed that the review would n't be complete until XX/XX/XXXX which is the deadline for the extension to pay the month of XX/XX/XXXX mortgage, that was given as a result of my complaining about the payment being incorrect ( as the escrow shortage has now been applied to my monthly payment ). I explained that if the review will not be complete until the XX/XX/XXXX then the payment would be considered late as I am waiting for the analysis again. I was told yes there would be a late charge and that I will still have to pay the shortage if Loancare decides that I have a shortage again.

I then called them to ask why would they pull that knowing that I had, had a loan with their sister-company but the representative could not give me a valid answer.

      "\t On XXXX XXXX, XXXX my wife and I closed on a VA home mortgage. When we closed we were informed by the closing attorney that our property taxes are being establish based on a normal tax year. Our initial escrow payment, paid at closing, was {$1000.00} for home owners insurance and {$2500.00} for one year of property taxes. Our home was a new construction loan, so at the time the taxes were accessed the lot was vacant. We were informed this was a possibility by our closing attorney. The XXXX property tax bill was {$610.00} and is due XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Our home owners insurance was paid in full for one year on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, which left the {$2500.00} for XXXX property taxes. When I received the property tax bill I called the loan originator and was informed that the loan was sold to Round Point Mortgage Servicing Corporation and would be effective XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I called to speak with them and was informed that they could not perform any action until after they have officially assumed the loan, however, the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX payment would still be due to them on that date. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I made my XXXX mortgage payment which was processed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and increased our escrow balance to {$2800.00}. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I called and asked how to handle this, and was informed by RPMS that they would complete an escrow analysis on the account and issue a refund check in the estimated amount of {$2100.00}. I also informed them that I received a {$610.00} property tax bill for XXXX and they confirmed that they had received the same amount. I was also informed that they planed to pay the tax bill in XXXX, which is 3 months past the due date. I was told the escrow analysis would be performed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and to call back at the end of the week to see if it was run earlier. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I called RPMS to receive the results of the escrow analysis that was scheduled to run on the XXXX. I was then informed that it was not going to be run until later that day and to check back in later. Later in the day on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I called to see if the analysis was complete. I was then informed that on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX the escrow department decided that they would not preform an escrow analysis on the account because I owed {$2500.00} in property taxes. After informing them that I was told a different story earlier in the day I was transferred to a supervisor. The supervisor then informed my that their records were accurate and dispute them I would have to request a tax audit on the account and then an escrow analysis could be run in XXXX on XXXX. I decided to call the closing attorney and see what I should do. He told me he would write a letter stating why the escrow account was established the way it was and should be enough documentation to push RPMS to run the escrow analysis. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I called RPMS back and informed them that I had reported their activity the VA Loan Center in XXXX and the closing attorney, as well as the actions taken by the attorney. I was then placed on hold for roughly 25 minutes and was transferred to a supervisor. He then told me that the escrow analysis was not necessary, however, because I was so adamant he would speak to the escrow department. I was placed on hold again for roughly 20 minutes. When the supervisor came back on the line I was told the escrow analysis was complete and a refund check would be issued in the amount of {$900.00}. I asked why the amount was so low I was told it was because my annual taxes are {$2500.00}. I informed him that that amount was not acceptable and wished to speak with someone in the escrow department and was told I could not. I then informed him that the XXXX taxes are only {$610.00} and the insurance premium was already paid in full. I was then told there was nothing more he or RPMS could do. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I received a letter in the mail with a refund check in the amount of {$900.00}.\n",

Over the last 2-years not only has the Creditors have became a Nightmare but the Credit Reporting Agencies Especially Equifax. Equifax prompts consumers to go online and do a dispute online, and even upload documents to prove the validity of the disputes. I have came to realize that Equifax online dispute process is a mere form of trickery, even after you upload documents to prove that the alleged accounts are inaccurate, Equifax refuses to remove the inaccuracies and prompts you to mail in the same documents to do a re-investigation ( which at this time may have taken up to 90 days ) to remove an error that was at fault by Equifax not doing their job as to report correct and accurate information. I have also learn that doing the online disputes not online takes more time and causes more financial burden to the consumers. Doing the online disputes with Equifax also protects them from any fault of the extremely poor investigation/ re-investigation process due to of their Aberration Clause. Below are some of the items that I have disputed several times with Equifax , and still these items show on my Credit Report from Equifax. Please see also were Equifax repeatedly hit my credit score with the inaccurate report from XXXX ( XXXX ) within the last 3 days I have loss points towards my overall credit score because of Equifax please see the attached documents.

I noted this within a matter of days and contacted Comenity Bank to notify them of the unauthorized transaction. The bank closed that account and issued a new card and had me complete paperwork to initiate an investigation. I was informed that I would not be responsible for paying that sum until and unless the investigation was complete and I were found liable. Despite this assurance, I soon received two statements from Comenity Bank, one for the new account, and one for the closed account under fraud investigation. Under the closed account it was stated that I had a minimum payment due of {$32.00} and demanding payment. As I had been informed not to pay this as I was not liable, I telephoned Comenity Bank to question this. I spoke to a representative ( which I audio recorded as my state is a one party consent state ) and questioned why I was having payment demanded of me for an issue still under investigation. I was informed that this was a mistake and that the statement should never have been issued to me. I was informed that payment was not due and I was not to pay it. However, I am now receiving notices from Credit Reporting Bureaus that I am delinquent on this payment. I telephoned Comenity Bank this evening, XX/XX/2019 ( and again recorded the call ) to ask why I was being listed as late in payments when I was specifically told that payment was not due and that I was not to make the payment. Comenity Bank states that I do not owe a payment as the investigation is still pending .... yet they have reported me as being delinquent in payment. I am greatly concerned as I have a credit score of XXXX as I am very careful with my credit and having a late or missed payment on my record is troubling. Especially troubling as, unless I am mistaken, it is unlawful for Comenity Bank to demand payment or list me as late on this payment while it is still under a fraud investigation. If this reflects negatively on my credit I will be seeking full reparations and punitive actions against Comenity Bank as I should not be reported as late or having missed a payment when this issue is under a pending fraud investigation for a purchase I did not make. \n",

It it just a slip of paper that shows the total amount of the payment received.

We will council the teller so it doesn't happen in the future. '' This doesn't happen at the branch level, someone at headquarters ( HQ ) level who monitors accounts is changing it after the branch receives the payment.

Experian has ruined my life, my excellent credit score of XXXX points and still refused to assist me. Experian accused me of filing a false credit card lost or stolen.

There are XXXX things in my report ONLY : 1 ) XXXX XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX in regards to my townhouse that I owned since XXXX 2 ) XXXX XXXX Credit Card 3 ) XXXX XXXX XXXX 4 ) XXXX Credit Card Everything else should be removed or deleted since I have already contacted the merchants that I have disputed due to Identity Theft or Fraud since I have been a victim of Identity Theft. I have in my hands a proof of letter from XXXX XXXX that it will remove my fraudulent account since I cooperated with XXXX XXXX with the investigation by sending them a police report, my driver license, my work ID and social security card. Experian still refused to remove the XXXX XXXX fraudulent account on my credit report. Experian failed to investigate my report thoroughly while XXXX exceeded my expectation with the investigation by removing XXXX XXXX on my report. Why is it Experian hated me so much and caused me tremendous amount of stress, anger and frustration in regards to my excellent credit score of XXXX points that I have ALWAYS maintained? I would like Experian to assist me by bringing back my score of XXXX points again. Thank you.\n",

( I have attached letters and documents verifying this. ) The move out notice was signed by the manager of XXXX, XXXX XXXX. The month prior to my move out I was given a letter that said I owed a prorated amount of {$160.00} for my last months rent. When I went on the billing website to pay this amount in XX/XX/XXXX, the amount they showed as due was approximately {$2000.00}. I immediately called and asked how they came up with this amount. The woman I spoke to on the phone assured me this was clearly an error and that she would correct the information. I followed up and checked the website a few days later only to discover that the information had not been corrected. The following weeks I continued to check the website and the amount due still had not been corrected. I called multiple times and when I did get someone on the telephone they assured me the information had been corrected online, but that it didn't show the corrected amount on my end. ( I have attached call logs verifying dates/times. ) I contacted the office and asked to pay the original amount due of {$160.00}.

I did have an appointment scheduled to do a final walkthrough of the premises however, the apartment manager never showed up to that appointment. I went to the front office and physically handed the apartment keys to the front desk person. I was told that this was acceptable since the office manager never made it to the walkthrough appointment that we had scheduled. I have attached copies of pictures of the apartment. The picture of the laundry room is not in my building. The community laundry room is in a separate building however, Ive included this picture to show the condition of the apartment complex. The picture of the ceiling in the bathroom was from a leak in the upstairs apartment. It took over a week for this to get fixed and consequently I was without water in the bathroom and had not shower. The pictures of the insects are just one example of the inhabitability of the unit ; the picture of the thermostat references how hot the apartment was w/o air conditioning. It was over 90 degrees. I had my toddler daughter living with me, so it was concerning to have her in that high heat for so long. It took over a week as well to get the air conditioner fixed. The living conditions at the apartment complex was horrible as referenced by the attached pictures. I had cockroaches the entire time I lived there, even with the unit being sprayed bi-weekly. There are other fees as well that they claim I owe. On the statement they gave me they claim that I owe for the entire month of XXXX although I only lived there 8 days. They are charging me a concession charge back fee of {$460.00} which I believe is for the discount I received for being in the medical field. They are charging re-letting fees in the amount of {$540.00}, which are again unnecessary as I gave appropriate and timely notice to vacate. They are charging a notice fulfillment fee for {$1200.00}. This amount is more than double my initial rent. My monthly rent was {$600.00}. These additional fees are fraudulent! The apartment complex has numerous complaints filed with the XXXX for their unethical and shady practices. I am formally requesting that the law offices of XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) remove the collection from my credit report as Ive made SEVERAL attempts to pay with no resolution.
